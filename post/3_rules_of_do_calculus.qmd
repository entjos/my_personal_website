Using those rules one can identify causal effects even in situations in which the commonly applied back-door criteria does not apply.

Before we can dive into Pearl's *do*-calculus and look at some examples, we first need to introduce a bit of specific notation. First, let $G$ be a directed acyclic graph which is associated with a causal model, let $G_\overline{X}$ be a submodel of $G$ in which we remove all arrows going into $X$, and let $G_\underline{X}$ be a submodel of $G$ in which we remove all arrows going out of $X$. Secondly, let $\do(x)$ define an operator for intervening on $x$. Hence, $P(y|\do(x'))$ indicates the value of $y$ if we would change the value of $x$ to the value $x'$. Lastly, let $X \ind Y$ denote that $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other.

Pearl defines in his book *Causality* the three rules of *do*-calculus which can be used to identify causal effects with the help of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs):

**Rule 1** (Insertion/deletion of observations) 
$$
P(y|\text{do}(x), z, w) = P(y|\text{do}(x), w) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\!\perp Z|X,W \text{ in } G_{\overline{X}}
$$

**Rule 2** (Action/observation exchange) 
$$
P(y|\text{do}(x), \text{do}(z), w) = P(y|\text{do}(x), z, w) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\!\perp Z|X,W \text{ in } G_{\overline{X}, \underline{Z}}
$$ 

**Rule 3** (insertion/deletion of actions)
$$
P(y|\do(x), \do(z), w) = P(y|\do(x), w) \text{ if } Y \ind Z|X, W \text{ in } G_{\overline{X}, \overline{Z(W)}}
$$

where $Z(W)$ is the set of $Z$-nodes that are not ancestors of any $W$-node in $G_\overline{X}$.

Please note that rule 2 can be simplified in case we are only looking at one action. In that case we can write:

$$
P(y|\text{do}(x), w) = P(y|x, w) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\!\perp X|W \text{ in } G_{\underline{X}}
$$ 

Let's use these rules of *do*-calculus for identifying causal effects in some example graphs.

The first example in @fig-dag-a might seem trivial, but I thought it might be a smooth start. In this graph there are no arrows connecting $X$ and $Y$ in $G_\underline{X}$, that is if we remove all the arrows going out of $X$. Hence, $X$ and $Y$ are independent in $G_\underline{X}$, which means that we can apply rule 2 of *do*-calculus:

$$
P(y|\do(x)) = P(y|x)
$$

Using *do*-calculus we could replace all the *do*-statements with observed variables, which now allows us to estimate the causal effect of changing $X$ on $Y$ based on our observed data. This was quite an easy example. But before we continue with the next example, let's take a closer look at $G_\underline{X}$ again. The reason why we are interested in looking at the graph in which we remove all errors going out form $X$ is that we want to make sure that $X$ is only affecting $Y$ directly or through causes that are caused by $X$, i.e., we are interested in the total effect of $X$ on $Y$. Thus, if we remove all arrows going out $X$ or going into $Y$ and we find that in this submodel there is no open causal path between $X$ and $Y$, we can assure us that in the whole model $G$ all causal paths between $X$ and $Y$ must be direct paths, i.e., paths that we want to include in our estimation.

@fig-dag-b includes a classical example of confounding, in which the variable $Z$ confounds the effect of $X$ on $Y$. If we remove all arrows going out of $X$, we find that $X$ is still associated with $Y$ through the fork $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$. Hence, we cannot directly disentangle the direct effect of $X$ on $Y$ and the association between $X$ and $Y$ that is due to the confounding of $Z$. However, as stated in rule 2 we can also condition on other variables to render $X$ and $Y$ independent in $G_\underline{X}$.

$$
\begin{split}
P(y|\do(x)) & = \sum_z P(y|\do(x), z) P(z|\do(x)) & \\
& = \sum_z P(y|\do(x), z) P(z|x) \\
& = \sum_z P(y|x, z) P(z|x) \\
\end{split}
$$

Ok, let's go through this in more detail. The first step we need to do is to condition our analysis on the variable $Z$. This renders $X$ and $Y$ independent in $G_\underline{X}$. Secondly, we replace $P(z|\do(x))$ with $P(z|x)$ as $X$ and $Z$ are independent in $G_\underline{X}$. Lastly, we can now replace $P(y|\do(x), z)$ with $P(y|x, z)$ as $X$ and $Y$ are independent when conditioning on $Z$.

@fig-dag-c again is a more simple example. In this graph $X$ and $Y$ are independent in $G_\underline{X}$ because $Z$ is a collider on the path $X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y$. Hence, we can just calculate $P(y|\do(x))$ based on our observed data $P(y|x)$.

@fig-dag-d is a tricky one and in contrast to the graphs before, we cannot only rely on rule 2 in order to identify the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$. Using only the back-door criteria would not allow us to identify the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ in this graph, but using *do*-calculus we actually can identify this effect. For this, let's first take a look at the effect that we would like to estimate:

$$
P(y|\do(x)) = \sum_z P(y|\do(x), z) P(z|x)
$${#eq-dag-d-1}

Unfortunately, we cannot estimate the first part of the right hand hand side directly using only observed data, but we can achieve this with the help of both rule 2 and 3.

$$
\begin{align}
P(y|\do(x), z) & = P(y|\do(x), \do(y)) && \text{Rule 2: } Y \ind Z \text{ in } G_{\overline{X}\underline{Z}} \\
& = P(y| \do(y)) && \text{Rule 3: } Y \ind X \text{ in } G_{\overline{X}\overline{Z}} \\
& = \sum_x P(y| x, z) P(x) && \text{Rule 2: } Y \ind Z |X \text{ in } G_{\underline{Z}}
\end{align}
$${#eq-dag-d-2}

Now, we yielded an expression for the first part of the right hand sind that only includes observed variables. Let's do the same for the second part to the right hand side in @Eq-dag-d-1. Translating this part of the equation to an expression only including observed variables is actually very much easier as $Y$ is a collider on the path $X \leftarrow W \rightarrow Y \leftarrow Z$ which renders Z and Y independent in $G_\underline{X}$.

$$
\begin{align}
P(z|\do(x)) = P(z|x) && \text{Rule 2: } Z \ind X \text{ in } G_{\underline{X}}
\end{align}
$${#eq-dag-d-3}

Now, we have all pieces that we need in order to translate @Eq-dag-d-1 into an expression only including observed variables. Let's substitute @Eq-dag-d-1 with @Eq-dag-d-2, and @Eq-dag-d-3:

$$
P(y|\do(x)) = \sum_z P(z|x) \sum_{x'} P(y| x', z) P(x')
$${#eq-dag-d-4}

Please not that we used $x'$ in @Eq-dag-d-4 in order to differentiate between the $x$ in $\do(x)$ and the $x$ observed in our dataset. The second part of @Eq-dag-d-4 means a summation over all observed values of $X$ independently of the value that is chosen for $\do(x)$.

By the way, if you don't want to buy Pearl's causality book, but your still interested in reading more about *do*-calculus you can find a short introduction to *do*-calculus by Pearl [here](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.4852.pdf). This paper also links to some other interesting applications of *do*-calculus including e.g. [selection bias](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r381.pdf) and [transportability](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r372-a.pdf) analysis.
