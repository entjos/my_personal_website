description: "Presenting and discussing research findings is at the heart of research and probably also the most fun part of it. On this side you can find a list with some selected talks of mine. You can also find the presentations slides for each talk in the list below. For some talks, I also provide some additional material, e.g., scripts that I used to create the figures and tables included in a talk."
