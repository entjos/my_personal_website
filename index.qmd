# About me

I am a biostatistician working at [Red Door Analytics AB](https://reddooranalytics.se/about-us/joshua-entrop/) with a passion for health data and statistical analyses. My research interests lie in applied biostatistics and clinical epidemiology. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics/Epidemiology in 2025 at Karolinska Institutet, where I worked with the [cancer epidemiology group](https://ki.se/en/research/research-areas-centres-and-networks/research-groups/clinical-cancer-epidemiology-research-group-karin-ekstrom-smedby). My thesis focused on developing and applying modern statistical methods to study childbearing in lymphoma survivors.

I am particularly drawn to the statistical and methodological challenges of analysing registry and survival data. For me, the most exciting part of the research process is to use novel statistical models to uncover insights that arenâ€™t immediately apparent.

All my blog posts on R are also kindly shared on the [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) website.
